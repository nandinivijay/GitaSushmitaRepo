Q : Explain Karate Framework?
Ans: Karate is an open-source API test automation tool. API tests are written using Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) Gherkin syntax.
 Unlike other BDD frameworks like Cucumber, Specflow or JBehave, Karate has all the step definitions written for us so we don't have to worry about writing them.
