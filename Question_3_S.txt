Explain the difference between Test Plan  and Test Strategy document:

1)A test plan describes in detail the scope of testing and the different activities performed in testing whereas A test strategy is a high-level document containing some guidelines about the way testing will be carried out.
2) A test plan is specific to a particular project whereas A test strategy is usually for a complete organization.
3) It describes the whole testing activities in detail – the techniques used, schedule, resources, etc whereas It describes the high-level test design techniques to be used, environment specifications, etc.
4) It is prepared by the test lead or test manager whereas It is generally prepared by the project manager.
5) A test plan document includes components like – features to be tested, components not to be tested, approach to testing, pass-fail criteria, test deliverables, estimates, assumptions, etc 
  whereas A test strategy document includes – scope, test approach, testing tools, test environment specifications, release control, risk analysis, etc.
6) Test plans can be changed or updated whereas test strategy is usually not changed.
